Importing Data in R

You can use the data() function to load these datasets in R. If you run the data function without
an argument, R will display a list of the available datasets.

data()


If you want to load a specific dataset, just enter its name in the parentheses of the data()
function. 
For example, let’s load the mtcars dataset, which has information about cars that have
been featured in past issues of Motor Trend magazine.

When you run the function, R will load the dataset. The dataset will also appear in the
Environment pane of your RStudio. The Environment pane displays the names of the data
objects, such as data frames and variables, that you have in your current workspace.

The readr package

In addition to using R’s built-in datasets, it is also helpful to import data from other sources to
use for practice or analysis. The readr package in R is a great tool for reading rectangular data.
Rectangular data is data that fits nicely inside a rectangle of rows and columns, with each
column referring to a single variable and each row referring to a single observation.


Here are some examples of file types that store rectangular data:

● .csv (comma separated values): a .csv file is a plain text file that contains a list of data.
They mostly use commas to separate (or delimit) data, but sometimes they use other
characters, like semicolons.

● .tsv (tab separated values): a .tsv file stores a data table in which the columns of data
are separated by tabs. For example, a database table or spreadsheet data.

● .fwf (fixed width files): a .fwf file has a specific format that allows for the saving of
textual data in an organized fashion.

● .log: a .log file is a computer-generated file that records events from operating systems
and other software programs.
